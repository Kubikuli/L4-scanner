# CHANGELOG

- Performs port scan on specified IP address or hostname using TCP or UDP protocols
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
- Allows specifying custom timeout, source network interface and port ranges
- Uses multithreading to speed up scanning

Known limitations:
- Platform dependent (works on Linux only)
- Please excuse my code being a little bit clunky here and there... it is my first C++ project
